File: partial_trajectory.py generates partial trajectories

The zip file contains 200 partial trajectories generated from partial_trajectory.py. Each trajectory has 8 partials

recon_img.zip contains reconstructions from naive loss function AE. Including loss fn plot.

guided_recon.zip contains reconstructions from loss with guidance from true parameters. Including loss fn plot.

rnn_AE.py is the script where loss is naive.

guided.py is the script where loss is guided by true parameters.


Update:

sliced_VAE.py is the script for RNN-VAE.
Its reconstruction images are contained in the folder VAE.
Comparison between reconstrucion using true parameters and original trajectories are in the folder "compare"
